  <h3 class="routing-guide-h3">Final Note</h3>
  <p><span class="text-bold">This guide is designed to be practical, not precise.</span> The federal civil rights laws we enforce are varied and complex. When we list a section for routing, it does not mean that the section will necessarily have enforcement authority for that report. It also does not mean this section is the only one who might have enforcement authority. Being listed here only means this section is likely best positioned to know the right next step for this kind of report.</p>
