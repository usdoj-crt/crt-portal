Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on {{ date_of_intake }}, about your report, number {{ record_locator }}. 

# What we did:

The Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative at DOJ carefully reviewed your report.  The Initiative is located within DOJ’s Civil Rights Division.  Based on the information in your report, our team determined that the situation you described does not appear to be within the jurisdiction of the federal civil rights laws we enforce. For that reason and in the exercise of our enforcement discretion, the Division will take no further action regarding your correspondence.


# What you can do:

We have included a list of resources for veterans that may be helpful.

- If you are a veteran in crisis, or know of someone who needs immediate support, contact the VA's Veterans Crisis Line by dialing 988, then press 1.  Or online at [https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/](https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/)

- If you have a complaint about the Department of Veterans Affairs, contact the Office of the Inspector General through their complaint portal at: [https://www.vaoig.gov/hotline/online-forms](https://www.vaoig.gov/hotline/online-forms)

- If you are a veteran who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, or a family member, call the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans, at 1-877-424-3838.

- If you are a veteran in need of legal assistance, the Office of General Counsel at the VA has compiled this list of legal resources for veterans: [https://www.va.gov/OGC/LegalServices.asp](https://www.va.gov/OGC/LegalServices.asp)
