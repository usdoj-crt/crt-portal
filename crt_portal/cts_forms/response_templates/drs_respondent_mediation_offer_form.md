Dear {{ organization_name }}:

The Disability Rights Section of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice (the Department) has received a complaint alleging a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The ADA is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in everyday activities.

We are offering you an opportunity to resolve your dispute with the complaining party through informal means. The Department sponsors a mediation program to allow parties to reach quick and satisfactory resolutions. Your complaint is an appropriate candidate for referral to this service. We are enclosing information about the ADA Mediation Program for your review. You may find more information about the ADA, including the regulations and other information, at [www.ADA.gov](http://www.ADA.gov).

Through the mediation process, an impartial mediator helps the parties resolve their differences. Mediation usually involves one or more meetings between the disputing parties and the mediator. It may also involve one or more confidential sessions between one party and the mediator. A successful mediation results in a binding agreement that satisfies both parties. Mediation proceedings are confidential.

The role of a mediator is not to act as an advocate or judge, but, rather, to help the parties reach a mutual agreement. Mediation is informal and representation by an attorney, while permitted, is not required. The mediators participating in this program are trained in the legal requirements of the ADA. The mediators also have access to neutral experts from the local community.

Mediation through this program is free and is available in your community through the Key Bridge Foundation. If you have questions about this service, you may call the Key Bridge Foundation toll free at (888) 528-1609 (voice) or (800) 630-1051 (TTY).

Participation in mediation is voluntary. The complaining party has agreed to participate. The Key Bridge Foundation will be contacting you to discuss your participation. If you choose to participate, the Department will not take any further action in this matter while mediation is ongoing. If an agreement is reached with the complaining party, the Department will close its file on this complaint. Participation may thus avoid involvement by the federal government, potentially substantial expenses from litigation, and possible monetary damages. If you choose not to participate, the Department may formally investigate the complaint and pursue this dispute through the legal means available to the Department under the ADA.

We hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to resolve your ADA complaint.

Sincerely,

ADA Mediation Program
Disability Rights Section

##**Resolving ADA Complaints Through Mediation**

The Department of Justice’s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Mediation Program (the Program) informally resolves ADA complaints, allowing parties – the person who filed the complaint and the business or local government named in the complaint – to develop mutually agreed upon solutions that comply with the ADA.

Using professional ADA-trained mediators throughout the United States, the Program provides a confidential, voluntary way to resolve ADA complaints fairly and quickly.

##**Why Consider Mediation?**

**Free**

There is no cost to either party to participate in mediation. It is not necessary for parties to have a lawyer to participate in mediation.

**Party-Driven**

Mediation allows the parties, not a judge or the mediator, to control the outcomes of their dispute. Parties work together, and there is room to negotiate the terms of the agreement and the timeline for implementation. The matter is not closed until the parties verify that all of the terms of the agreement have been implemented. Either party can withdraw from mediation at any time.

**Confidential**

Conversations and materials produced during the mediation sessions are confidential.

**Quick**

Mediation is scheduled promptly as opposed to investigations or court cases which can take months or years.

**Preserves Relationships**

The cooperative, voluntary approach can preserve relationships between parties and produce win-win results.

**Successful**

The Program has successfully resolved thousands of ADA disputes resulting in increased access for people with disabilities and has saved businesses and State and local governments time and money.

For more information about the ADA and the ADA Mediation Program, visit our website at: ada.gov, or call the ADA Information Line at 800-514-0301 (Voice) or 1-833-610-1264 (TTY).
