Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on {{ date_of_intake }}, about your report, number {{ record_locator }}.

If you would like DOJ to evaluate your claim, please submit your dates of military service, your military orders, copies of any letters a military lawyer sent on your behalf about this issue, and any other documents about your claim to servicemembers@usdoj.gov.

Please note that we are unable to investigate every SCRA complaint we receive.  Furthermore, although the DOJ files SCRA lawsuits in the name of the United States on behalf of affected servicemembers, we cannot form an attorney-client relationship with any individual servicemember, and we cannot provide legal advice or opinions to individuals.

In addition, your issue may be covered by other federal, state, or local laws that we do not have the authority to enforce.  Your state bar association or local legal aid office may be able to help with your issue.  You may reach these offices by visiting their websites at:

**Legal Services Corporation**
[www.lsc.gov/find-legal-aid](www.lsc.gov/find-legal-aid)
(202) 295-1500

We hope that this information is helpful.  Please do not hesitate to contact the DOJ if we may be of further assistance with this or any other matter.

Very Respectfully,

Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative
U.S. Department of Justice
