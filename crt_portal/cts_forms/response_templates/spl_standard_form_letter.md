{{ addressee }},

Thank you for your letter on {{ date_of_intake }}.  Your report number is {{ record_locator }}.  Please refer to it if you write us in the future.  This letter will tell you how the Special Litigation Section will review your report and what other options you may choose to pursue.

The Special Litigation Section only handles cases that arise from widespread problems that affect groups of people.  We do not assist with individual problems, except as noted below.  In general, we cannot help you recover damages or any personal relief.  Nor can we assist in criminal cases, including wrongful convictions, appeals or sentencing.  We also cannot assist with issues involving federal facilities or federal officials.  

There are only two areas in which the law allows us to investigate and address individual incidents:  
- if you are being prevented from practicing your religion in a prison, jail, mental hospital or other facility operated by or for a state or local government; or
- if you have encountered a physical obstruction or experienced force or the threat of force when accessing a reproductive health care facility or religious institution.

Each week, we receive many reports of potential violations.  We analyze this information to help us select new cases or pursue existing cases.  We will review your letter to see if it fits into one of these two categories.  If so, we may contact you for additional information.  If not, we will not contact you as unfortunately, we do not have the resources to follow up on every letter.

The Special Litigation Section protects the civil rights of: 
- people in state and local correctional facilities and institutions for people with disabilities
- people when they interact with state and local law enforcement agencies
- children in the administration of juvenile justice
- people who confront a physical obstruction, force or the threat of force when they seek access to reproductive health care clinics or religious institution
- people seeking to practice their religion while in state and local institutions
- people with disabilities seeking to receive needed services in integrated, community settings
