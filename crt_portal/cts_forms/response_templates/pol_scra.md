- The creditor must forgive this interest retroactively, back to the first day of SCRA eligibility.

[%optional group="SCRA Rights" name="License Portability"]

In January 2023, Congress added a new provision to the SCRA that allows servicemembers and their spouses to use their professional licenses and certificates when they relocate due to military orders, in certain circumstances. All professional licenses are eligible under the SCRA except for law licenses.
<br/>
To qualify for professional license portability under the SCRA, you must:

1. Have moved to a location outside the jurisdiction of the licensing authority that issued the covered license or certificate because of orders for military service.
2. Provide a copy of the military orders to the licensing authority in the new jurisdiction.
3. Have actively used the license or certificate during the two years immediately preceding the move.
4. Remain in good standing with:
    1. the licensing authority that issued the covered license or certificate; and
    2. every other licensing authority that issued a license or certificate valid for a similar scope of practice and in the discipline applied for in the new jurisdiction.
5. Submit to the authority of the licensing authority in the new jurisdiction for the purposes of standards of practice, discipline, and fulfillment of any continuing education requirements.

If you meet these five criteria, the new jurisdiction must consider your license or certificate valid at a similar scope of practice for the duration of the military orders.
