{{addressee}},

Thank you for contacting the Department of Justice on {{date_of_intake}}. The Housing and Civil Enforcement Section is reviewing your report. In this letter, we explain how we will review your report and provide you with other options to pursue.

**Your report number is {{record_locator}}. If you want to ask us about your report, this number will help us locate your information.**

What happens now?
================

We are reviewing your report. We look at reports like yours to help us select new cases or pursue existing ones. We will review your report to see if it fits into one of these two categories. If so, we may contact you for more information.

Unfortunately, we cannot investigate every complaint. Our office generally handles only cases arising from widespread problems affecting groups of people. We do not investigate complaints based on individual claims of discrimination. If we are unable to investigate your complaint, we will not contact you.

To avoid missing out on an opportunity to get help, we recommend that you file a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as laid out below.

If you are experiencing housing discrimination:
===============================================

HUD investigates individual claims of housing discrimination. This may include discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability in housing. If you are experiencing housing discrimination, we recommend that you file a complaint with HUD.

You may also file a complaint with HUD if you believe your housing rights under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) have been violated. HUD has provided information about VAWA’s housing protections at [https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/VAWA](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/VAWA).

You can file a complaint with HUD online at [https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint](http://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint), or call 1-800-669-9777 or TTY: 1-800-877-8339.

You have one year from the date of the discrimination or violation to file with HUD or they will not review your complaint.

If you need help paying your rent or utility bills:
===================================================

The CFPB may help you identify resources for which you may qualify, at [www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/‌renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/).

If you are experiencing discrimination in lending or credit:
============================================================

You can file a complaint with HUD at [https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint](http://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint) and with the CFPB at [www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/).

If you would like to hire an attorney:
======================================

You may want to consult a private attorney to see if you have any rights under other federal and state laws. If you do not have an attorney, your state bar association or local legal assistance agency may be able to help. Search for a local attorney at [www.lsc.gov/find-legal-aid](http://www.lsc.gov/find-legal-aid).
