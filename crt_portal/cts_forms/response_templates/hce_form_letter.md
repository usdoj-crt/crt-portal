{{ addressee }},

Thank you for contacting the Department of Justice on {{ date_of_intake }}.  This letter will inform you about how we will review your report and what you can do in the meantime.  Your report number is {{ record_locator }}. Please refer to this number in the future if you want to ask us about your report.

We will carefully review your report and will contact you if we need additional information and/or are able to open an investigation.  Please be aware that in situations involving the type of discrimination you have alleged; the Civil Rights Division generally becomes involved only when groups of people are affected.  We generally do not open investigations based on individual claims of discrimination.

In the meantime, here are some suggestions for what you can do:

- If your complaint relates to discrimination in housing, you may want to [file a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”)](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint). _(Please note that you have one year from the date of the discrimination to file a complaint with HUD.)_
- If your complaint relates to discrimination in lending, you may want to file complaints with HUD and with the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/).
- If you need assistance with paying your rent or utility bills, [the CFPB’s website may help you identify available resources that you may qualify for](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/find-help-with-rent-and-utilities/).

For more information about the Housing Section and our work, [please visit our web page](https://www.justice.gov/crt/housing-and-civil-enforcement-section).

For more information about credit, disability rights, housing rights, and more, [please visit our Housing related resource page](https://civilrights.justice.gov/housing-resources).

You also may wish to consult a private attorney to determine what claims, if any, you may have under other federal and state laws.  If you do not have an attorney, you may find your [state bar association](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_services/flh-home/) or [local legal assistance agency](https://www.lsc.gov/find-legal-aid) helpful in locating an attorney to discuss your complaint.


Sincerely,
