Dear {{ organization_name }}:

The purpose of this letter is to inform you that we have closed the complaint {{ record_locator }} filed against {{ organization_name }} for alleged violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). As you know, in an attempt to facilitate an informal resolution of this dispute, we referred the dispute to a mediation service. We have been informed by that service that mediation successfully resolved the dispute. Therefore, we will take no further action in this matter.

If you have any general questions about the ADA, please contact our toll-free ADA Information Line at 1-800-514-0301 (voice) or 1-833-610-1264 (TTY).

Sincerely,

ADA Mediation Program
Disability Rights Section
