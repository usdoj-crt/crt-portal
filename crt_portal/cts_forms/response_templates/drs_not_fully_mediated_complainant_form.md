{{ addressee }}:

The purpose of this letter is to inform both parties that we have closed the complaint {{ record_locator }} filed against {{ organization_name }} for alleged violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). As you know, in an attempt to facilitate informal resolution of this dispute, we referred the dispute to a mediation service.

We have been informed that mediation was not undertaken or that mediation did not fully resolve the dispute. After consideration of this matter, we have decided to close the complaint without resolving this issue. However, our decision should not be seen as a determination that {{ organization_name }} has not violated the ADA. We may at any time decide to re-open our investigation or to conduct a compliance review even in the absence of a particular complaint.

Our decision also does not affect the rights of individuals to bring actions in federal district court for violations of the ADA. In addition to contacting a private attorney, private citizens may consult their state bar association or local legal aid office at Legal Service Corporation (or Legal Aid Offices), [www.lsc.gov/find-legal-aid,](http://www.lsc.gov/find-legal-aid) (202) 295-1500, or may find a local disability rights agency at: [www.ndrn.org/about/ndrn-member-](http://www.ndrn.org/about/ndrn-member-agencies)[agencies.](http://www.ndrn.org/about/ndrn-member-agencies) You may also wish to call your Regional ADA National Network Center, funded by the U.S. Department of Education. By calling 1-800-949-4232 (voice and TTY), you will be connected automatically to the center serving your region. The center can assist you in understanding the ADA and can refer you to local entities or individuals who may be able to provide further assistance.

If you have any general questions about the ADA, please contact our toll-free ADA Information Line at 1-800-514-0301 (voice) or 1-833-610-1264 (TTY) or visit our website at ada.gov.

Sincerely,

ADA Mediation Program
