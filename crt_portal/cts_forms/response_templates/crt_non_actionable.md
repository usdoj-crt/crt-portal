{{ addressee }},

You contacted the Department of Justice on {{ date_of_intake }}. After careful review of what you submitted, we have decided not to take any further action on your complaint.

# What we did:

Team members from the Civil Rights Division reviewed the information you submitted.  Based on this information, our team determined that the federal civil rights laws we enforce do not cover the situation you described.  Therefore, we cannot take further action.

Your report number is {{ record_locator }}.

# What you can do:

Your issue may be covered by other federal, state, or local laws that we do not have the authority to enforce. We are not determining that your report lacks merit.

Your state bar association or local legal aid office may be able to help with your issue even though the Department of Justice cannot.

Thank you for taking the time to contact the Department of Justice about your concerns. We regret that we are not able to provide more help on this matter.

Sincerely,

U.S. Department of Justice
Civil Rights Division
