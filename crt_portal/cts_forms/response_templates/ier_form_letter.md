{{ addressee }},

You contacted the Department of Justice on {{ date_of_intake }}. After careful review of what you submitted, we have determined that your report would more appropriately be handled by another federal agency.


What we did:

Your record number is {{ record_locator }}.

Team members from the Civil Rights Division reviewed the information you submitted.  Based on your report, our team determined that you alleged employment discrimination based on citizenship, immigration status, or national origin, or other employment-related issues.

Federal law limits the Civil Rights Division’s ability to handle a matter such as yours. Under federal law, we:

  - Investigate individual claims of employment discrimination based on citizenship, immigration status, and (for small employers) national origin, and
  - Do not administer immigration benefits or handle employment related claims that belong to other agencies.

Unfortunately, the Civil Rights Division does not appear to have authority to handle a report like yours. If you would like to discuss an issue regarding possible employment discrimination based on your citizenship, immigration status, or national origin, you can contact the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section’s free worker hotline at 1-800-255-7688.  Callers can remain anonymous and language services are available.


What else you can do:

We are not determining that your report lacks merit.  Another federal agency may be able to help in your situation.

We have included a list of federal agencies that may be able to help. You should reach out to the appropriate agency if you want to pursue this further.

NOTE: There are strict time limits for filing complaints related to employment discrimination. If you feel you have been discriminated against in employment, you should contact the appropriate agency as soon as possible.
