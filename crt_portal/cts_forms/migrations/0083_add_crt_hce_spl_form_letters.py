You contacted the Department of Justice on {{ date_of_intake }}.

What we did:

Team members from the Civil Rights Division reviewed the information you submitted. Based on your report, our team determined that you alleged discrimination in one of more of the following areas:

1) housing;
2) public accommodations, such as hotels and restaurants; or
3) credit.

Please be aware that in situations involving these types of discrimination, the Civil Rights Division generally becomes involved only when groups of people are affected. We generally do not open investigations based on individual claims of discrimination.

{{ addressee }},

You contacted the Department of Justice on {{ date_of_intake }}.  Based on our review to this point, we want to make you aware that you may want to contact your state’s PREA Coordinator.

What we did:

Your record number is {{ record_locator }}.

Team members from the Civil Rights Division reviewed the information you submitted.  Based on your report, our team determined that you raised concerns involving sexual abuse or sexual harassment in detention.  This may fall under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). PREA is a law that makes it illegal to:

- sexually abuse or sexually harass prisoners and detainees; and
- retaliate against a prisoner or staff member who reports sexual abuse or sexual harassment.

We will continue to review your report and will contact you if we need additional information.  However, you should be aware that in situations involving sexual abuse or sexual harassment of prisoners and detainees, the Civil Rights Division can only become involved where there is a widespread pattern of misconduct.  Therefore, we generally cannot open investigations based on individual claims.

Accordingly, we want to make you aware that your state’s PREA Coordinator may be able to help in your situation.  A PREA Coordinator can investigate individual claims such as yours. To help you connect to your state’s PREA Coordinator, we have included a directory with this response.

What you can do:

Your state’s PREA Coordinator may be able to help in your situation. You can contact your state’s PREA Coordinator by referring to the attached directory.

You can also learn more about PREA at the PREA Information Center’s website: www.prearesourcecenter.org/training-technical-assistance/prea-101/prisons-and-jail-standards

How you helped:

Your report will help us advance civil rights. Information from reports such as yours helps us understand emerging trends and issues in civil rights. This helps inform how we protect the civil rights of all people in this country.

You contacted the Department of Justice on {{ date_of_intake }}. This letter is in response to your report.

What we did:

Your report number is {{ record_locator }}.

Team members from the Civil Rights Division reviewed the information you submitted.  You indicated that you have filed a discrimination complaint with or against another Federal agency.

The Department of Justice does not serve as a reviewing authority for the decisions of other Federal agencies following their investigations of complaints about discrimination.

Therefore, we will not take further action.

What you can do:

This letter is not a determination that your report lacks merit. Your state bar association or local legal aid office may be able to help.
