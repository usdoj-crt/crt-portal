# Extends and unsets bindings for each instance, meaning they can be run in
# isolation by tests, etc.
#
# Ports configured here are bound to the containers but not on the host machine, meaning multiple groups of these standalone containers can exist on the same host.
#
# Certain containers are excluded from the test env entirely with the "not-tests" profile.
