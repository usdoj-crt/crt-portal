# Maintenance or infrequent tasks

## Change protected class options

The PROTECTED_CLASS_FIELDS control the order that they fields show up, the nickname of the filed for the CRT view and the variable sometimes used by the model. We derrive three variables from PROTECTED_CLASS_FIELDS: PROTECTED_CLASS_CHOICES determine what is populated in the form. PROTECTED_MODEL_CHOICES determine what is allowable data in the models. PROTECTED_CLASS_CODES are what we display in the crt backend.

So for the old record, we don't want to change them, because we don't know how people replied to the form, but going forward, we don't want to give "National origin (including ancestry, ethnicity, and language)" as an option on the form anymore.

To do that, we would keep that and add the new classes "National origin" and "Identity" in PROTECTED_CLASS_FIELDS. We don't change any of the old data. Make sure you have the correct order to the new elements. You may need to write a targeted data script if you need to converge or merge records. An example would be crt_portal/cts_forms/migrations/0049_fix_other_duplicates.py

If you want to keep the old record as is, write a migration to remove the sort order from the old object and make sure it is not listed in PROTECTED_CLASS_FIELDS. Also adjust the other filed's sort order as needed.

We would then make sure that the "Other" javascript was pointed at the correct element.The "Other" options needs to be last because the other reason explanation text question is implemented as a separate question below the protected class question.

To rename existing models, change the name in model_variables.py PROTECTED_CLASS_FIELDS and create a data migration like: crt_portal/cts_forms/migrations/0045_alter_protected_class_choices.py.

You should be able to reorder the form by setting the value in the database or making a data migration to update the protected classes and form_order. Do NOT use the Django admin for this task, you can [use the Django shell](#use-the-django-shell) to help figure out what the migration should be.

## Add a new optional form
See example code here: https://github.com/usdoj-crt/crt-portal/pull/209/files

1) Make any model changes in models.py, such as new fields. Create and then apply the migration

2) Make a form class in forms.py. You can inherit pieces of other forms if this form is similar to another.

3) make a function to determine when you want the form to show on the front end

4) Add the form class and the function to urls.py

5) In views.py
    - add the new page name for the form page `to all_step_names`
    - add the top-line title for the page to `ordered_step_titles`
    - add an existing or template to the `TEMPLATES` list

## Debugging tips

### Front end
If you are trying to figure out what variables are getting passed to the template you can add the following code in any template:

    <pre> {% filter force_escape %} {% debug %} {% endfilter %} </pre>

### Back end
#### Use the Django shell
SSH into a docker image so you have local database access, (your image may have a different name)

    docker exec -it crt-portal_web_1 /bin/bash

get into the project directory where we can run the Django shell

    cd crt_portal
    python manage.py shell

This takes you into an interactive shell it adds `>>>` to the beginning of lines

import your models or whatever you are working with

    from cts_forms.models import *

Start typing and try out code interactively.

#### pdb
The built in python debugger is good for setting traces.
See the [pdb documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/pdb.html) for details

## Single sign on
#### Setting environment variables
Request the set up with JMD. When they get things set up on their side, they will be able to supply:
    AUTH_CLIENT_ID
    AUTH_SERVER
    AUTH_USERNAME_CLAIM
    AUTH_GROUP_CLAIM

Those variables need to be set, as well as the secret key if you already have VCAPSERVICES. You can check the current settings first, in case you need to revert them with:

    cf env crt-portal-django

Update VCAPSERVICES it with the following command, replacing `<value` with the correct value in double quotes.

    cf uups VCAP_SERVICES -p '{"SECRET_KEY":<value>,"AUTH_CLIENT_ID":<value>,"AUTH_SERVER": <value>,"AUTH_USERNAME_CLAIM":<value>,"AUTH_GROUP_CLAIM":<value>}'

You can check that it is in the environment correctly with:

    cf env crt-portal-django

Note that you need to redeploy or restage for the changes to take effect.

The other variables to set are `AUTH_RELYING_PARTY_ID` and `AUTH_AUDIENCE` these are based on the url are not sensitive so they can be put into the manifest. See the prod and stage manifests for examples.

### Adding the ca bundle to S3

JMD will also be able to provide you with a certificate bundle. We will want that in a private S3 bucket.

If it doesn't already exist in the environment, create a private bucket called `sso-creds`. See [cloud.gov S3 documentation](https://cloud.gov/docs/services/s3/) for more details.

    cf create-service s3 basic sso-creds

Then you can connect to the bucket and upload the file using the AWS command line tools [these commands](https://cloud.gov/docs/services/s3/#using-the-s3-credentials). For that script, `SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME=sso-creds` and
`KEY_NAME=sso-creds-key`. Some local installs may be required.

Upload the certificates to `sso/ca_bundle.pem` in the private bucket. Using the AWS CLI.

    aws s3 cp ./your-path-to-ca-bundle-file s3://${BUCKET_NAME}/sso/ca_bundle.pem

Add `sso-creds` to the seervices part of the manifest. That will bind the bucket to the app on deploy. To add sso to another environment, follow the steps above and add the AUTH_RELYING_PARTY_ID and AUTH_AUDIENCE to the relevant manifest.

Make sure to update the auth settings to include the new environment.

See documentation for the ADFS Django package- https://django-auth-adfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Code changes

Add the environment to add auth urls condion in urls.py and adding the environment to the auth conditions of settings.py.

crt_portal/crt_portal/settings.py

    # for AUTH, probably want to add stage in the future
    -if environment == 'PRODUCTION':
    +if environment in ['PRODUCTION', 'STAGE']:
         INSTALLED_APPS.append('django_auth_adfs')


crt_portal/crt_portal/urls.py

    environment = os.environ.get('ENV', 'UNDEFINED')
    -if environment == 'PRODUCTION':
    +if environment in ['PRODUCTION', 'STAGE']:
         auth = [
